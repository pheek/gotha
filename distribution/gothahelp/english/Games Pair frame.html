        You can unpair some or all games by selecting games and clicking on the Unpair Button.
        <h2>Modify a game</h2>
        You can modify the colour/handicap of a given game by selecting that game, right-clicking and choosing "Exchange Colours" or "Modify handicap".
        <h2>Change table numbers</h2>
        Table numbers are chosen by OpenGotha according to availability.

        <br>You can change a given table number by selecting that game, right click, choose "Change table number", then enter a new number.
        If necessary, OpenGotha will automatically renumber the game previously assigned to the target table.
        <br>In some tournaments, you may happen to use different rooms with table numbers starting from a number other than 1. For instance, the available tables willl be tables 25-48, tables 156-234, etc.
        To do that, select a table, right click, choose "Shift tables" and a new table number for the selected game. Subsequent table numbers will be shifted as well. However, table numbering should remain inside 1 to 600 limits.
