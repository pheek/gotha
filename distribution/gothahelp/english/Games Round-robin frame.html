        The Games Round-robin frame is usable only for small tournaments (20 players max).
        <br>Manual pairing and results entering can all be done in a single frame.
        <br>You don't have to worry about round numbers. OpenGotha will internally manage that for you,
        so that export functions will work exactly as if you had followed the usual complete process.
        <br><br>If you need to enter by default results, use
            <a href="Games Results Frame.html"> Games Results Frame</a>
