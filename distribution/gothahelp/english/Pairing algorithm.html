        <br>
        OpenGotha's pairing system is based on <a href="Pairing evaluation function.html">an evaluation function</a> and a maximum matching algorithm.
        <br>To pair a set of n players, OpenGotha first computes a cost for each pair of players, that is to say n*(n-1)/2 costs. The cost is computed by an evaluation function.
        A low cost means an undesirable pairing while a high cost means a desirable pairing.
        Then these n*(n-1)/2 costs are input to the maximum matching algorithm which finds the set of n/2 couples that gives the maximum sum of costs.

        <h2>The maximum matching algorithm</h2>
        OpenGotha's pairing system is based on an O(n^3) implementation of Edmonds' algorithm, as presented by Harold N. Gabow.
        The development is part of the UCSB JICOS project. Adaptation for OpenGotha has been made by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Bocquet.
