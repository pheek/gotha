        <h2>Rating Lists</h2>

        <br>A copy of each of the rating lists is delivered with OpenGotha. You can download up-to-date rating lists by clicking the "Update XXX rating list from ..." button.
        <br>These rating lists enable fast and spelling-error-free access to known players. Type in the first letters of the player and known players with same first letters will show up.
        If you are not sure of first letters, then use Levenshtein algorithm. OpenGotha will do its best to find players with similar names.
